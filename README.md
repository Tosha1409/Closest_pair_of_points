**# Closest_pair_of_points**
I was doing Codility Rubidium challenge while and at some point it required to check algorithm for finding pair of points with smallest 
distance between them. I didnt used it in the end for Rubidium cause task was a bit different, but it was good to refresh memory(i did
saw it before) and i decided to write my version from scratch later.
So i started to make it yesterday and when it was almost done i decided to recheck links that i saw before:
https://medium.com/@andriylazorenko/closest-pair-of-points-in-python-79e2409fc0b2
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/closest-pair-of-points-using-divide-and-conquer-algorithm/
2nd link was in C++, and first in Python and i decided to take a closer look at python solution and realized that it is pretty much
rewritten C++ solution. Python is more flexible language and allow to makes more elegant solutions. So I decided to make more Pythonesque 
solution
